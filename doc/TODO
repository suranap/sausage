* Pattern match library

** Separate the structures and pattern matcher into different libraries 
** Add pattern guards to the matcher
** Allow pattern predicates to take parameters (maybe guard is good enough?)
** Translate define-structure to S48's define-record-type
** Add support for record disclosers 


* Sets 

** Copy implementation of red-black trees from DrScheme's library
